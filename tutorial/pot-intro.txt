A single turn potentiometer in a variable resistor connection can be
used in volume control applications. The potentiometer is interfaced
to the Sensor port as shown in the following circuit. The internal
pull-up and the potentiometer are in voltage divider configuation. The
voltage drop across the potentiometer is measured by the ADC. The code
to read the voltage from the sensor input is given below.
