A single turn potentiometer in a variable resistor connection can be
used in volume control applications. The potentiometer is interfaced
to the ADC module as shown in the following circuit. The potentiometer
is connected in voltage divider configuation. The voltage drop across
the bottom half of the voltage divider is measured by the ADC. The
code to read the voltage from the ADC input is given below.
