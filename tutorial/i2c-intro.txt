I2C is a bi-directional two-wire (data and clock) serial bus that
provides a communication link between integrated circuits. Examples of
simple I2C-compatible devices found in embedded systems include
EEPROMs, thermal sensors, and real-time clocks.

I2C IO Expander (PCF8574) provides 8 digitial IO lines that can be
controlled, through the I2C bus. The IO Expander can be interfaced to
the I2C module as show in the following circuit. The code to access
the I2C IO Expander is listed below.
