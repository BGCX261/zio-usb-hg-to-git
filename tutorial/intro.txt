ZIO is a IO framework for rapid product development. And as such it
comes along with an API that can be used to access the IO interfaces
provided by the board. This document shows how to use the API, to do
simple tasks, which can then be used as a reference for building
complex applications.

From the API's stand point, the ZIO motherboard has 5 modules.

  1. GPIO
  2. I2C
  3. Sensor
  4. PWM
  5. SPI

These modules on the motherboard are accessed through an agent
software running on the motherboard. The agent software communicates
with the PC and performs appropriate actions on the modules.
