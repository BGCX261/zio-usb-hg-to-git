ZIO is a IO framework for rapid product development. And as such it
comes along with an API that can be used to access the IO interfaces
provided by the board. This document shows how to use the API, to do
simple tasks, which can then be used as a reference for building
complex applications.

The ZIO motherboard has 6 modules: `GPIO`, `I2C`, `ADC`, `DAC`, `PWM`
and `SPI`. Each module is in charge of a set of signals associated
with the module. The modules and their associated signals is shown in
the following diagram.

These modules on the motherboard are accessed through an agent
software running on the motherboard. The API communicates with the
agent and performs actions on the modules. Each module is handled by a
separate object class in the API. The modules and their corresponding
classes are described in detail in the following sections.
