The brightness of an LED can be controlled by driving the LED using a
PWM signal. PWM is a digital control technique wherein the processor
adjusts the duty cycle of a sequence of fixed-width pulses. The LED
can be interfaced to the PWM module as shown in the following
circuit. When the duty cycle increases, the ON period of the PWM
signal increases and the LED brightness increases. The code to control
the LED brightness is given below.
