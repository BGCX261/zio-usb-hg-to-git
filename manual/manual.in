ZIO Recipes
------------

GPIO Port
~~~~~~~~~

.Connecting LEDs

Connect the anode of the LED to an `Output` signal, and the cathode to
GND. The built-in series resistor is sufficient to limit the current.

image:led.png["Single LED",width=288]

.Connecting series of LEDs

Since the `Output` signal can not provide sufficient power for more
than one LED, and external power source is to be used. And the power
supply can be controlled using a MOSFET switch. 

image:led-series.png["Series of LEDs",width=288]

The circuit diagram for connecting a series of LEDs is shown
above. The following formula can be used to calculate the resistance
for the current limiting resistor. (The voltage drop across the MOSFET
is considered to be negligible.)

R = (V~cc~ - NV~d~) / I~d~

Where,

V~d~ ::
Voltage Drop Across LED

N::
No. of LEDs

I~d~::
Current for the required brightness

V~cc~::
LED supply voltage

R::
Current Limiting Resistor

As an example, for the following parameters,

  * V~cc~ = 12V
  * I~d~ = 11mA
  * N = 4

the calculated current limiting resistance is 470 ohms.

.Connecting relays

Relays are used to control a high-voltage/high-current circuit with a
low-voltage/low-current signal. A relay can be connected to the ZIO
through a MOSFET as shown in the following circuit diagram.

image:relay.png["Relay",width=288]

.Isolating outputs using opto-coupler

There are situations in which signals from one subsystem need to be
electrically isolated from another subsystem in an electrical
equipment. For example, a microcontroller operating at 5V, controls
the power to a load operating at 230V AC. In such situations, the
microcontroller needs to be electrically isolated from the high
voltage section, using a opto-coupler.

Note that, though relays can also be used for this purpose, they are
generally bulky, slow, unreliable, and power hungry.

image:opto-coupler.png["Opto-coupler",width=288]

.Connecting to CMOS/TTL inputs

CMOS/TTL inputs can be directly connected to the `Output` signal. An
example of shift register connected to the `Output` signals is shown
in the following circuit diagram.

image:cmos-ttl-input.png["CMOS/TTL Inputs",width=288]

.Connecting Switches

Switches can be directly connected between the `Input` and `GND`. When
the switch is pressed the `Input` signal will be low, and when the
switch is released the `Input` signal will be become high due to the
built-in in pull-up resistor.

image:switch.png["Switch",width=288]

.Detecting External Voltage

Any external voltage input can be connected to the ZIO `Input` signal
through a MOSFET or a BJT. An example circuit using a MOSFET is shown
below.

image:voltage-mosfet.png["Detecting external voltage using MOSFET",width=288]

If the input voltage (V~s~) is greater than the threshold voltage of the
MOSFET, the `Input` signal will be low, or else it will be high.

An example circuit using a BJT is shown below.

image:voltage-bjt.png["Detecting external voltage using BJT",width=288]

If the input current (I~s~) is greater than (I~t~ = 0.5mA / h~FE~),
the `Input` signal will be low, or else it will be high. For all
practical purposes, a (I~t~ = 1mA) input current is sufficient to make
the `Input` signal go low. The base resistance (R~b~) has to be chosen
to make the `Input` signal low, when the required input voltage is
driven.

R~b~ = (V~s~ - V~be~) / I~t~

.Connecting an Analog Comparator

An analog comparator can be used to identify if the input voltage is
larger than a specified reference voltage. Any operational amplifier
can be used as a comparator, but a dedicated comparators like LM339
which provide open collector CMOS/TTL outputs are suitable for
interfacing with logic circuits. An example circuit is shown in the
following diagram.

image:comparator.png["Comparator",width=288]

.Isolating inputs using opto-coupler

As in the case of outputs, inputs can also be electrically isolated
using opto-couplers.

image:opto-coupler-input.png["Opto-coupled Inputs",width=288]

I2C Port
~~~~~~~~

.Connecting 5V I2C devices

Since the I2C signal are pulled up to 5V, 5V I2C devices can be
directly connected to the I2C port.

image:i2c-device.png["5V I2C Device",width=288]

.Connecting 3.3V I2C devices with 5V tolerance

Any 3.3V I2C device with 5V tolerance can be directly connected to the
I2C port. The device can be powered from an external 3.3V supply, or
the 3.3V supply can be generated from the `+5V Power` using a
regulator. An example circuit with the commonly available LM1117-3.3
regulator is shown below.

image:i2c-5v-tolerant-device.png["3.3 I2C Device with 5V tolerance",width=288]

.IO Expander

Additional digital inputs and outputs, if required, can be obtained
using a I2C IO expander. The PCA8574 provides 8 digital I/O lines,
and PCA8578 provides 16 digital I/O lines. An example circuit using
the PCA8574, with I2C device address set to `0x20`, is shown below.

image:io-expander.png["IO Expander",width=288]

SPI Port
~~~~~~~~

.Connecting 5V SPI devices

Since the SPI signal are 5V TTL/CMOS signals, 5V SPI devices can be
directly connected to the SPI port.

image:spi-device.png["5V SPI Device",width=288]

.Connecting 3.3V SPI devices with 5V tolerance

Any 3.3V SPI device with 5V tolerance can be directly connected to the
SPI port. The device can be powered from an external 3.3V supply, or
the 3.3V supply can be generated from the `+5V Power` using a
regulator. An example circuit with the commonly available LM1117-3.3
regulator is shown below.

image:spi-5v-tolerant-device.png["3.3 SPI Device with 5V tolerance",width=288]

Sensor Port
~~~~~~~~~~~

Resistive Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.Connecting a Potentiometer

The position of potentiometer can be sensed by connecting the
potentiometer to the sensor input as shown in the figure below. When
the centre pin 2 of the potentiometer is moved from pin 1 to pin 3,
the raw value varies from 0 to N~max~. Where N~max~ is given by the
following formula.

N~max~ = (0xFFFF x R~max~) / (R~max~ + 10K)

Here,

  * R~max~ is the maximum resistance of the potentiometer
  * 10K is the internal pull up resistor on the Sensor signal. For
    more details refer <<sensor-port>>.

For a 10K potentiometer, N~max~ = (0xFFFF x 10K) / (10K + 10K) = 0x7FFF

image:pot.png["Potentiometer",width=288]

.Connecting a Resistive Sensor

Sensors whose resistance varies with the parameter being measured are
called resistive sensors. Examples of resistive sensors are Light
Dependent Resistor (LDR), thermistor, etc. These sensors can be
directly connected between the `Sensor` signal and `GND`. As the
parameter being measured varies, the resistance varies accordingly,
and the raw value (N) produced is given by the following formula.

N = (0xFFFF x R) / (R + 10K)

Here,

  * R is the resistance of the sensor
  * 10K is the internal pull up resistor on the Sensor signal. For
    more details refer <<sensor-port>>.

An example circuit, using the LDR, is shown below.

image:ldr.png["LDR",width=288]

Voltage Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.Voltage measurement, -3V to +3V

Though the ADC input range is 0 to 3V, it is possible to measure
voltages between -3V and +3V using a simple circuit. The circuit
diagram is shown in the figure below.

image:voltage-sensor-3v.png["Voltage measurement -3V to +3V",width=288]

To better understand the operation of the circuit, the circuit is
shown with the internal pull-up resistor on the `Sensor` signal, in
the following diagram. 

image:voltage-sensor-3v-internal.png["Internal circuit",width=288]

Using superposition, the voltage at `Sensor 0` is given by the
following formula.

Voltage at `Sensor 0` = 1.5V  + V~i~ / 2

As V~i~ decreases from 3V to -3V, the voltage at the `Sensor 0`
decreases linearly from 3V to 0V, and the raw value from 0xFFFF to 0.

`--------------`--------------------------`-----------------
V~i~ (V)	Voltage at `Sensor 0` (V)  Raw Value
------------------------------------------------------------
3		3			   0xFFFF
0		1.5			   0x7FFF
-3		0			   0
------------------------------------------------------------

.Voltage measurement, -15V to +15V

The following circuit can be used to measure voltages in the range
-15V to +15V. The input voltages and the corresponding raw values is
shown in the table below.

image:voltage-sensor-15v.png["Voltage measurement, -15V to +15V",width=288]

`--------------`--------------------------`-----------------
V~i~ (V)	Voltage at `Sensor 0` (V)  Raw Value
------------------------------------------------------------
15		3.0			   0xFFFF
0		1.5			   0x7FFF
-15		0.0			   0
------------------------------------------------------------

Non-resistive Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.Transistor Buffer

Non-resistive sensors usually generate a voltage signal that varies
with the parameter being measured. Such sensors cannot be directly
connected to the `Sensor N` signal, due the signal being pulled-up to
3V using a 10K resistor. A transistor buffer can be used to overcome
this problem. The transistor isolates the sensor from the pull-up. A
transistor buffer circuit is shown below.

image:transistor-buffer.png["Transistor Buffer",width=288]

This is a PNP emitter follower, where the emitter voltage is almost
equal to the base voltage. For a V~i~ range of 0 to 4.4V, the voltage
at `Sensor 0` is (V~i~ + 0.6). To compensate for the added 0.6V,
subtract 0.6 to the obtained voltage.

.Temperature Sensor

The LM35 is an example of an non-resistive sensor. The LM35 produces a
voltage that is proportional to the temperature. The voltage output by
the LM35, increases by 10mV for every degree Celsius rise in
temperature. As the temperature changes from 2^o^C to 150^o^C, the
voltage rises from 0V to 1.5V. The LM35 can be connected to the Sensor
port using the transistor buffer and is shown in the following
circuit.

image:temp-sensor.png["Temperature Sensor",width=288]

PWM Port
~~~~~~~~

.LED Brightness Control

An LED can be connected between the `PWM N` signal and `GND` as shown
in the following diagram. When the duty cycle is varied the LED
brightness varies accordingly.

image:led-brightness.png["LED Brightness",width=288]

.One Bit DAC

An analog output can be generated from the PWM signal, using a low
pass filter circuit. The low pass filter circuit with an op-amp buffer
is shown in the following diagram.

image::pwm-dac.png["PWM DAC",width=288]

If the analog output has a frequency of F, the PWM frequency should be
much higher than F. The values of R and C are given by the
following formula.

RC = 1 / (2 image:pi.png["PI",width=5] F)

For an output frequency of 1kHz, choosing R = 4kohm, C = 0.04uF.

.DC Motor Control

A DC motor's speed and direction of rotation can be controlled using
the PWM port. The DC motor has to be interfaced through a circuit
called the H-Bridge. A simple H-Bridge constructed using switches is
shown in the following diagram. By controlling, the switches the motor
can be made to rotate forward, reverse, brake, and free run. The
various switch states and their effect on the motor is shown in the
following table.

image:h-bridge.png["H-Bridge",width=432]

`-------`-------`-------`-------`-----------------------
S1      S2      S3      S4      Function
--------------------------------------------------------
0       0       0       0       Free-run
0       1       1       0       Reverse
1       0       0       1       Forward
0       1       0       1       Brake
1       0       1       0       Brake
--------------------------------------------------------

Forward::
The current to flows in one direction through the motor.

Reverse::
The current flows in the opposite direction through the motor.

Brake::
Applying same voltage to both the terminals, counters the back EMF
produced by the motor, and causes it to come to a sudden stop.

Free-run::
Power is cut-off from the motor, and the motor free-runs and
eventually stops.

To control the motor through digital signals, the switches are
replaced by transistors / MOSFETs. Driver ICs like the L298, that
implement the H-Bridge can also be used for motor control
applications. The block diagram of one half of a L298 is shown in the
following diagram.

image::l298.png["L298 full-bridge driver",width=288]

By controlling the inputs, various functions can be selected, as shown
in the table below.

`-----`----`----------------
In1   In2  Function
----------------------------
0     0    Brake
0     1    Reverse
1     0    Forward
1     1    Brake
----------------------------

When in Forward state or Reverse state, the speed of the motor can be
controlled by driving the inputs with a PWM signal

`----------------`----------------`----------------------------------------
In1 (Duty Cycle) In2 (Duty Cycle) Function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0%               0%		  Brake
100%		 100%		  Brake
0%		 100%		  Reverse, full speed
100%		 0%		  Forward, full speed
0%		 X%		  Reverse, speed proportional to duty cycle
X%		 0%		  Forward, speed proportional to duty cycle

Software Installation
---------------------

Under GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported distributions are:

  1. Debian 5.0.4 (Lenny) and above
  2. Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) and above
  3. Mint 5 (Elyssa) and above
  4. Fedora 9 and above

TIP: In the following sections, commands that have a
`#`  (hash) prompt, should be executed as `root`.
In case of Ubuntu, the command should be invoked using `sudo`.

The .deb software packages present on the CD-ROM can be installed using the apt-get command . 
For this to work, the BSP CD-ROM is to be added as a repository. Insert the BSP CD-ROM and add the CD-ROM as a repository,
using the following command, before trying to install packages through steps explained in the following sections.

----
# apt-cdrom add
----

ZIO Driver
^^^^^^^^^^

The ZIO motherboard is accessed through a USB serial interface. The
ZIO USB serial driver is available in kernel since version 2.6.34.

Plug the ZIO Motherboard into the USB port. `dmesg` should report that
the device was detected and attached to `ttyACMx`. This device file
name should be used to communicate with the board. The exact device
filename can be obtained using `dmesg`. A sample listing is shown
below, where the device file name is indicated as `ttyACM0`.

------
$ dmesg | tail
usb 2-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 5 using ehci_hcd
cdc_acm 2-1.2:1.0: This device cannot do calls on its own. It is not a modem.
cdc_acm 2-1.2:1.0: No union descriptor, testing for castrated device
cdc_acm 2-1.2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
usbcore: registered new interface driver cdc_acm
cdc_acm: USB Abstract Control Model driver for USB modems and ISDN adapters
USB Serial support registered for zio
usbcore: registered new interface driver zio
------

The device file generally belongs to the `dialout` group. Users who
would like to access the device should be a member of the `dialout`
group. The user `xyz` can be added to the `dialout` group using the
following command.

------
# usermod -a -G dialout xyz
------

In case of Fedora distribution, users should be a member of the
`lock` group and `uucp` group in addition to the `dialout` group, in order to access
the device file. This can be done for an user `xyz` using the following commands.

------
# usermod -a -G lock xyz
# usermod -a -G uucp xyz
------

^^^^^^^^

.Step 1

Install the .deb/.rpm package using the following command:

-------
$ cd /media/cdrom/software
# apt-get install zio-java-api 	               # Under Ubuntu/Mint/Debian
# yum --nogpgcheck localinstall zio-java-api-*.rpm # Under Fedora
-------

.Step 2
The `CLASSPATH` environment variable should point to the serial
library and the ZIO API. A possible command sequence is shown
below. This can be added to your `.bashrc` file.

-----
$ export CLASSPATH=.
$ export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar
$ export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/zio-java-api.jar
------

.Step 3
Test your installation using the Java program available on the CD-ROM
at `software/TestZio.class`. When executed with the following command,
it will prompt for the serial device file and will then test access to
the board through the Java API.
